# browizard
A javascript browser compatibility checker based on Caniuse data

# Install
It's better to install browizard globally on your machine:

`npm i -g browizard`

# How to use
You can run browizard directly in a folder to scan, or provide a remote directory like this:

```
browizard --directory|d=<DIRECTORY-PATH>
```

# Thresholds
You can provide a thresholds for any browser listed below. Any provided browser version will be compared to the final report for **less or equal** versions.

The script will return a `0` exit code if succeed, else `1`.

You can pass thresholds like the following (be sure to pass [a valid](https://jsonlint.com/) JSON object **between simple quotes**):
```
browizard --threshold|t='{"chrome": "60", "firefox": "55", "edge": "16"}'
```

It will either return a success message like: `Threshold validity check terminated successfully` or a detailed error message like: `Invalid threshold on chrome. Expected: 60 or less, current: 70.` with an exit code `1` (so it can be used in CIs).

# How it works
The script will deep read all of the `.js` files and search for prototypes functions. Then it'll ask the MDN Javascript API for compatibility.

The script outputs something like that:

Minimal supported versions for scanned files are: {
  chrome: '70',
  chrome_android: '70',
  edge: '18',
  firefox: '63',
  firefox_android: '63',
  ie: '9',
  nodejs: true,
  opera: '57',
  opera_android: '49',
  safari: '9',
  safari_ios: '9',
  samsunginternet_android: '8.0',
  webview_android: '≤37'
}
Checking threshold validity...
Threshold validity check terminated successfully
Process exited with code:  0
Execution time: 8423ms
```
You've got:
* The filename after it has been completely scanned (and the read status)
* The minimal supported version for each browser
* The threshold check status (if option provided to the command)
* The process exit code (0 = success | > 0 = error)
* The script execution time

# Why you should be aware using it

Browizard (whatever how cool it is) isn't 100% reliable. Two main warning points:

### It only crawls your files and take the **first** entry returned by the MDN API
Example:

In one of your files, there is the `indexOf` function. The scripts find it and checks the MDN API for minimal browser support versions. The dilemma is that there is three types of `indexOf` property:
* for `Arrays`
* for `Strings`
* for `TypedArrays`

But the support version isn't the same for a similar property (for the same browser!), so here's the limit:
* `Arrays`: `Chrome >=1`
* `Strings`: `Chrome >=1`
* `TypedArrays`: `Chrome >=45`

So if the `indexOf` prop scanned by the script in one of your files is for a `TypedArray`, the script will take the `Array` prop and will return a minimal version for Chrome of 1.

In main cases, other properties versions are overriding this error... but it is present!

### It's not possible to threshold versions with special chars
Example:

The MDN API returns minimal browsers versions for a given function. But in some cases (as you can see in the return example above) it will return versions with a special char like `≤`. In this case, it won't be possible to compare the versions given in the threshold with the ones given by the MDN API.


**So be careful if you want to break your CI execution if the threshold doesn't match the one you provided. It may be better using it for retriving minimal supported versions for your project.**
